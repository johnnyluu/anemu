Anemu is a mobile app for helping people of all ages identify Australian wildlife in an easy and visual way.  Users can use a photo of an animal they've taken with their phone and compare it to photos of other Animals, browsing based on how similar they think it looks.  Once they've identified the animal, they can look up scientific information about the animal, see the last reported location it was seen and even view a list of articles related to that animal.

This app can also be used to contribute back to the scientific community, as users can also add their own sighting to the database to help other get a clearer idea of where the animal lives.
Download the .apk file in the rootfolder to install on your Android devices.
